          <h4>sika</h4>
          <p class="lead">Can't open CB when loading files opened the last time</p>
          <p>I'm running codeblocks on ubuntu 6.10.</p>
          <p>Codeblocks is configured to open automatically the project and the files that were opened the last time I closed it.</p>
          <p>When I try to open codeblocks, the window simply doesn't appears. I see that CB is running in the background but the window doesn't show up. The only way to make it work is to kill CB. Then the next time i launch it, i get a message saying a tmp file has been deleted (/tmp/Code::Blocks-myname), and finally it works : i can see the window and everything works just fine !</p>
          <p>Another point : if I delete my foo.layout file, the problem disappears and I can launch CB normally...</p>
          <p>Once codeblocks is launched, I can open the project and the failes without problems.</p>
          <p>I've tried to completely uninstall codeblocks, reinstall the deb package, create a completely new project (with all the permissions) without changing the default config of codeblocks (except the option to open the last project and the last files)... and i still get the same problem...</p>

          <p>Another point :</p>
          <p>It seems like it is the error message that I get which make appears the window :</p>
          <p>I've just tried to switch the locale of CB to Chinese (simplified) to see if it would work (I was trying to compare with my app I'm currently trying to localize)... when i restart CB, i get the error message "cannot set locale to blabla" (which is normal as I don't have this locale installed). The interesting point is that the window appears just after this message...</p>
          <p>My conclusions (don't know if i'm right or wrong) :</p>
          <p>if a message box (whatever it is) shows up, the window is drawn.If there's no message box, the window is not drawn...</p>
          <p>don't know if it can help.</p>

          <p>Hi !</p>
          <p>I haven't used codeblocks for a few weeks but now, i've just installed the latest nightly (4185) and it seems to be solved !</p>
          <p>You can close this bug (I don't know if I can do it myself).</p>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
