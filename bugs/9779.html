          <p class="lead">Double clic on a .cbp under windows cause an error message</p>
          <p>If I launch a .cbp file by a double clic under Windows (2000 SP4 or XP SP2, french versions), I have the following problems, but only if CodeCompletion plugin is activated. This happen when leaving codeblocks (and sometimes when entering, but not systematicaly) :</p>
          <p>1) If my cbp file is opened, but I do nothing special, except looking at my source, and I want to close CB, an error message is displayed: Something like "File xxx.cbp (or one of its components) can't be found. Check the path and name...). On my pc it's in french and xxx is the correct full path of my project.</p>
          <p>2) if my .cbp is opened, but this time I make a build of my project, execute it,... when I close CB I have also an error message, but a slightly different one, always in french, but something like "There was an error while sending a command to the program".</p>
          <p>As told previously, this happen only when my cbp file is launched by a double clic. Everything is OK if I open CB and launch the same cbp file by a clic in the start window.</p>
          <p>If CodeCompletion plugin is disabled, launching a .cbp file with a double clic works fine.</p>
          <p>This problem appeared with nightly 1129_rev3312 and still there with nightly 1219_rex3398. It was OK with 1127_rev3289.</p>

          <p>I answered to a private mail, but as my reply was for admin at berlios, I'm not sure this was the right way for that. So, I copy here my answers :</p>
          <p>First answer (january 8):</p>
          <p>Effectively, no problems with the nightly build of 28 november (rev</p>
          <p>3295). So it really appears with nightly 1129_rev3312.</p>
          <p>gd_on</p>
          <p>Second answer:</p>
          <p>Some more informations since this morning.</p>
          <p>Always here with build 3464.</p>
          <p>Certainly the same bug described in <a href="9877.html" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Explorer crashes when double-clicking .cbp file to open C::B">bug #9877</a> (and by skirby with 3312 build).</p>
          <p>If you open by a double click a .cbp file, and code completion is activated, the completion taskbar remains empty. But if you switch on another file of the project (and come back), the task bar is now filled correctly (You obtain the same result if you switch to another Windows task and come back to CB). If you do nothing else, but simply close CB, you can obtain the error message, but if you wait a sufficient time, before closing (about 1 minute on my PC and with my project), it's OK, no error message.</p>
          <p>Everything happens as if when opening by a double click, code completion plugin takes a long time to initialize (and/or is waiting something), and if you close CB before the end of this phase, you have the problem. But if code completion has finished it's work, it's OK. May be also, when you open CB by launching the exe file and, in the startup window, you open a projet, the initialization phase of the plugin is not exactly the same or may be interrupted before it's end...</p>
          <p>Hope this help.</p>
