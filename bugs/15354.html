          <p>wxSmith is a complex plugin and this may benefit from being looked at by someone who better understands the internal workings.</p>
          <p>Very annoying, long-term bug. Confirmed in SVN 6190.</p>
          <p>The problem is caused by the use of a fake background when the user has not assigned a bitmap, which is always set to display at 0,0. This was done to make the control more visible, on the basis that it can be hard to see when empty. Frankly, I don't think we need this. It's quite visible enough and clicking on the control in the resource tree on the left makes it perfectly visible.</p>
          <p>Disabling the fake background solves the problem. A nice idea is to make the control have the simple border style by default, which does make it more visible. Another is to use a default bitmap when no other has been assigned. I was unable to make either of these happen in a way that the user can override by setting control preferences normally.</p>
          <p>Fixed in <a href="../patches/2940.html" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Add updating manifest.xml version to AutoVersion plugin">patch 2940</a>.</p>
