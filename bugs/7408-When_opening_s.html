          <p class="lead">When opening several files, the editor don't refresh</p>
          <p>While editing multiple files, when selecting another pane, the slider refresh accordingly to the size of the file, but the view stills with the content of the previous file. It doesn't happens on every file, only large files which have a bad function structure (which may fool the function folder feature). Happens especialy when you are modifying some files, and switching to another file to copy some code or get a look at it, then when you return to the previous file you were editing, the content is not refreshed, thus you cannot edit anymore, you have to quit (and getting a whole buch of annoying message boxes asking for saving files), then restart Code::Blocks.</p>

          <p>Update:</p>
          <p>In the mean time, I noticed that you keep submitting bug reports which</p>
          <p>a) are no bug reports at all, but feature requests</p>
          <p>b) are not well-formed and have no version info</p>
          <p>c) are outright wrong</p>
          <p>Out of half a dozen reports, this is the only one that actually is a bug report at all.</p>
          <p>Sorry to say it straight, submitting feature requests such as "must add a "save all function", as bug is hilarious. Not only is it not a bug, but the feature certainly exists.</p>
          <p>If you keep submitting feature requests like that as bugs, then I will close your reports without even reading them.</p>
          <p>Have a nice day.</p>

          <p>Report is closed.</p>
          <p>Note: This is a preformatted standard message.</p>
          <p>Possible reasons for closing this report are:</p>
          <p>* the developer in charge of the issue</p>
          <p>- could not reproduce it despite trying several times</p>
          <p>- did not get sufficient information</p>
          <p>- got no reply to an inquiry for specific information</p>
          <p>* the report is quite a bit dated of now, and</p>
          <p>- no user comments have been added for several weeks</p>
          <p>- significant changes have been made to the code</p>
          <p>- no other developer could reproduce it either</p>
          <p>It is assumed that the problem does not persist and the report</p>
          <p>can be closed.</p>
          <p>If the problem reappears in future releases, please feel free to</p>
          <p>re-open this report and provide precise information on how to</p>
          <p>reproduce it.</p>
