          <p class="lead">Copy doesnt always work on linux</p>
          <p>On Ubuntu Edgy (and possibly other linux distributions) copying text with Ctrl+C or cutting with Ctrl+X doesn't always work. This means that you can cut a section of text, but when you paste it will not paste the text you cut, but rather any text that was on the clipboard beforehand.</p>

          <p>Which wxWidgets version do you have?</p>
          <p>Does this happen with specific files?</p>
          <p>I tried to reproduce this by copying and pasting several parts of the C::B source code around but it worked every time (Ubuntu Edgy, wx2.6.3p2, rev 3564).</p>

          <p>I've just installed a clean install of Fiesty, so I cant check what wx version I was using. However I can tell you that it happened with ANY file, and it was a continuous problem for months with different nightlies. I'm just installing C::B on Fiesty, if the problem still occurs I'll post more info.</p>

          <p>OK, its still happening, this is on a clean installation of Kubuntu Fiesty, the only program I have installed is Code::Blocks.</p>
          <p>Build: 3562</p>
          <p>wx.2.6.1</p>
          <p>The best way to reproduce is to keep cutting and pasting lines of text with CTRL+X and CTRL+V. This bug only happens about a third of the time and happens with CTRL+C as well as cutting. If you test with cutting and pasting its obvious when the copy failed.</p>

          <p>I think you're using wx 2.6.3 w/ patch 2 because that's the version in Feisty repos. You can still check it by running:</p>
          <p>$ apt-cache show libwxgtk2.6-0 | grep Version</p>
          <p>But I can't still reproduce it. I created a file with "Line 1" to Line 5" on separate lines. I copy/cut pasted every line successfully. I also tested this on Feisty (through VMWare) and it still works.</p>

          <p>Hmm... this is a bit of a wierd one. You are right about the WX version, I was going by the version reported in the C::B about dialog.</p>
          <p>I can't understand why this would just happen to me? I've installed 2 different versions of Kubuntu cleanly so it cant be that, I thought perhaps hardware (keyboard) but the fact that the text is removed by the cut means its not that.</p>
          <p>Did you try Kubuntu or Ubuntu? Perhaps its a KDE thing? I dunno, I'm at a loss :/</p>

          <p>I agree that this is very strange problem. The editor component (Scintilla) will be updated (hopefully) soon so it might fix this but I can't promise anything.</p>
          <p>I'll post back once I've got my testing results on Kubuntu Feisty.</p>

          <p>This is now getting very VERY irritating. I'm still running Feisty, and as my project is getting larger this seems to occur more and more, now cut hardly ever works. I'm wondering if this is related to the size of the project, that might explain why simple tests don't show this up.</p>

          <p>It doesn't really seem to be a Code::Blocks bug. Many people using Eclipse, SPE and other editors have this problem too.</p>
          <p>For reference, check <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=153809">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=153809</a></p>
          <p>One suggestion is to disable Klipper or to just uncheck "Prevent empty clipboard".</p>
          <p>It seems to solve the problem, even thought it's a workaround.</p>

          <p>In the end I just got fed up and switched to GNOME, the problem hasn't occurred since.</p>
          <p>It is definitely a KDE problem, I had the same problem at work Feisty/KDE/Any CB version.</p>

          <p>Just as it has been said it's a KDE problem with Klipper, and it involves even more applications.</p>
          <p>Unchecking the option "Prevent empty clipboard" in Klipper solves it.</p>
