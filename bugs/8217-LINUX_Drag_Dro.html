          <p class="lead">LINUX: Drag&amp;Drop for text and tabs freezes X</p>
          <p>Every now and then when I select text, my X.org server freezes. I can move the cursor, CPU usage is low, but X just won't respond. so I have to restart X server and thus loose all my open files.</p>

          <p>I have this problem on SUSE Linux 10.1 and Ubuntu Dapper, too. It's not a bug in latest version, since I had it even in RC2.</p>
          <p>I never posted it because I really don't know on what depends and I'm not able to reproduce it. It happens in the cases kreso and caposite said, but it doesn't happen every time. I can't tell in which conditions this happens, but this is very annoying.</p>
          <p>Let me say that, after selecting the text, the mouse cursor switch into "drag&amp;drop mode" and then I can move it, but I can't click in any place.</p>
          <p>On Ubuntu I can't do anything but lose all data. On SUSE I'm able to use the keyboard and save modified files with CTRL+S and kill codeblocks from a console terminal (ctrl + alt + F1).</p>

          <p>I got a similar problem on SuSE Linux 10.1 with the august 26 build (revision 2910). It often happens when I accidentally move a selected text. The whole X.org server freezes with only the mouse still movable. That bug is pretty critical because it happened pretty often and forces me to restart the X server, losing any open programs and unsaved works.</p>

          <p>Happens to me too, I was just about to post a new bug report.  I notice it has something to do with selecting text ot draging the source file tabs around (the tabs you use to toggle between open files).  Here is my bug report:</p>
          <p>When you hae multiple source files open, the tabs for each source file are "VERY FRAGILE."  If you play with them just a little tiny bit too much, the mouse gets stuck with the drag icon and there is no way at all to click on anything or return it to normal.  I have to reset X with a ctrl-alt-backspace whenever it happens and it happens quite often (more then half the times codeblocks cloded, its because of this).  This bug is boyh in the stable release for gentoo, and my custom build checked out from svn named "Version 1.0 revision 2976 (2006-09-14 11:27:59) gcc 4.1.1 Linux/unicode"</p>
          <p>This happes to me when running code::blocks compiled with wxGTK running in gnome.  I havent used it enough on windows or in other desktop environments to know if they too are affected.</p>
          <p>PLEASE FIX, thanks :)</p>
