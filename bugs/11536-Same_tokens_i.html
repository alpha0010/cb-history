          <h4>rickg22</h4>
          <p class="lead">Same tokens in different projects, missing</p>
          <p>Here's a tricky one. Copy one project - any project - to a different directory. Open both the original and the cloned project in Code::Blocks.</p>
          <p>Switch to the symbols tab. Only one project displays the tokens when choosing "Active Project's symbols".  If I close one of the open projects (depending on which one was parsed first), the symbols don't appear either. I have to close C::B and open that project for the symbols to appear.</p>
          <p>I think this bug appeared after changing from "one parser per project", to "one parser per workspace": The parser thinks they're duplicate tokens, and functionally they are, but they refer to completely different files.</p>
          <p>This case hadn't been accounted for when CC. had been designed.  I don't think this could (or should) be fixed in the short term due to the 1.0 deadline. Perhaps we might need to discuss an appropriate solution in the forums.</p>

          <p>Although you 're right in what you 're saying, it will not be fixed. This "limitation" is a chosen one, i.e. it was taken into account when designing the thing.</p>
          <p>Your example is something that I doubt would ever happen to anyone in a real-world application/workspace.</p>
          <p>Hence I am not closing this but leaving it for future reference. Just don't expect any work on it for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Alright then. By the way, a possible (looooong-term) solution would be to include project id's in the parser, and keep the file-id's in an std::map of projects for each token.this way, we could, for example switch to the declaration / implementation  and navigate to different files according to the currently opened project. But then again, it's a long-term idea, possibly implemented in the next major version of CC.</p>
