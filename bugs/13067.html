          <p class="lead">Abort Button has a bug..</p>
          <p>Hi :)</p>
          <p>I've notice that with the Code Blocks Nightly Build I have installed the abort button, that terminates the program that you run under code blocks, doesn't work.</p>
          <p>I was able to close the window of program being executed but it does not enable the other buttons compile and run&amp;compile.</p>
          <p>I have tried waiting for it for 10 minutes but it seems its still stuck.</p>
          <p>My codeblocks nightly build version is SVN 4845</p>

          <p>If "abort button" real name is "Stop debugger", then most likely this is not a bug at all...</p>
          <p>The first time you press this button C::B just pauses the program just like in the breakpoint situation. If you want to stop debugging completely, then you have to press it one more time.</p>

          <p>Hi, I don't know if the previous name or the real name of the button I was refering to is "stop debugger". All I know is that when I hover my mouse on it, a label pops-up displaying the word abort. I always use this button to stop the window of the program Im test running in codeblocks. In RC2, it does the trick of closing the window of the program running and enables the other four buttons (in my precious statement its 2 but I notice there are other two) buttons "build", "run","build and run" and "rebuild". Tell me, did they change the function of this button? or its purpose remains the same as it was in RC2? Is this s proof of a bug or not? tell me....</p>

          <p>I have tried what you said, which is to click the "abort" button the second time. I didnt only clicked it  twice I click it several time more and this is what I got from the the "Build Log"</p>
          <p>Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!</p>
          <p>Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!</p>
          <p>Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!</p>
          <p>Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!</p>
          <p>Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!</p>
          <p>Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!</p>
          <p>Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!</p>
          <p>Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!</p>
          <p>Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!</p>
          <p>Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!</p>
          <p>Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!</p>
          <p>Count the number of "Aborting process 0 ... Be patient!" you can read, thats the number of times I click the Abort button (plus several more, didn't include the rest because it wont fir anymore) because you said so. What you said didnt solve the problem. The other 4 buttons remains stuck! Now tell me this is not a bug!</p>

          <p>I am able to reproduce this bug. The "abort" button jdstufu is referring to is in the compiler toolbar. It is active when using the "run" button, or the "build and run" tasks.</p>
          <p>My guess: the abort button isn't grabbing the correct PID of the compiled program, and so on. Works fine for stopping the build process, just not the actual result.</p>
          <p>Reproduced with SVN 4872</p>
