          <p class="lead">Crash when reparsing saved files</p>
          <pre class="pre-scrollable">Code::Blocks consistently crashes after 5 to 30 minutes.  Seems to be happen during reparsing after inserting new code.  Following trace suggests heap corruption.  (I will  try building it locally to see if it's a libc incompatibility.)
