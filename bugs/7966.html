          <p>so this was not a bug.</p>
          <p>Your screencast showed that in one case you were looking at the project settings, and in the other one at the target settings.</p>
          <p>The only thing I could say is, that in your demonstration you should have ended up twice in the settings of the project and not one time in the target settings. I'll try to look into this latter issue, but that's for another bugreport ;-)</p>

          <p>OK, now I finally see my confusion...</p>
          <p>My point now is going to be that this UI is really confusing. Why shouldn't the target reflect the inherited options of the project? I guess they'd need to be greyed out and un-editable, but then that would just be a different place for the confusion. Why do I get the default target's build options when I right-click-&gt;build options? I right-clicked a project, not a target. I can see that there probably are instances in which target-specific build options are necessary, but it seems like there's no reason for me to even know about them unless I have more than one target in a project. It seems to me that the "default" target options should be hidden until they are relevant (there exists more than one target). Additionally, it is a pretty confusing UI to have two ways of accessing the same dialog with no discernable context to differentiate them.</p>
