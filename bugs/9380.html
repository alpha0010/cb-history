          <p class="lead">Deletion of Folded code</p>
          <p>When folded code is deleted, it is removed from the editor, however, while compiling, it is as if the folded code was still there. I am using a Nov. 3 compiled binary.</p>

          <p>I am extremely sorry to say that I am no longer facing this problem, with the later builds. I was able reproduce it in the Nov. 3 build, but with the current build (Dec. 2 i think), the error is no longer appearing.</p>
          <p>Once again, I am sorry for any confusion this may have created, and realise that I should have discussed this in the forum first, and then also removed it from the bug database when I no longer experienced it.</p>

          <p>I would like to add, that at the time of the Nov. 3 bug, I was using windows, but now due to certain problems, am using linux (ubuntu), and no longer have access to windows. The bug might still be present in Windows.</p>
          <p>What I had done was create a number of classes for a particular program. I realised that at particular class was redundant, so I erased *all* traces of this. The compiler (mingw) gave errors with respect to the folded code that I had deleted. It was also clear that this was the folded code it was referring to, because suppose I had the lines:</p>
          <p>71 blah blah</p>
          <p>83 blah blah</p>
          <p>84 blah blah</p>
          <p>On deletion of the code, the numbers for lines 71 -&gt; 83 were not changed, and the compiler gave references to lines 76 or something.</p>

          <p>I think what happened (and yes it is still there) is that when you do just the selection of 71... it will not unfold the other lines (or delete them) it will keep them hidden. But if you select 71 and 83 it will delete the hidden part... Will find out how they want the results and fix this... Thanks</p>

          <p>ok, thanks for the confirmation then.</p>

          <p>This is not a bug. To delete a folded selection properly, select from column 1 of folded line to column 1 of *next* line. That would ensure proper deletion of folded text.</p>
          <p>This behaviour is consistent with other Scintilla based softwares.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>
