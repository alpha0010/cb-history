          <p class="lead">Code completion is unusably slow</p>
          <p>Hello,</p>
          <p>in latest versions the code completion seems to be unusable. I have downloaded latest nightly build and than tried to edit some projects. If the project is small (for ex. embedded design) everything is ok, but with larger projects (codeblocks source, wx form project, ...) every typing is extremely slow. I write 5 characters and they show up in 2 seconds. After disabling the cc plugin cb works fine.</p>
          <p>I have found many issues related to code completion, but not relating this slow behaviour. Is there any solution? I remember that older versions worked better.</p>

          <p>Hello,</p>
          <p>where can I upload the test project, please? But maybe it is not neccessary. I have tried it today with latest nightly, clean installation. I have created a new blank wxSmith project (wx sources in $wx variable). Every typing in the source is very slow. In case of a very long word (something like: asdf asasdf askdjfhaskdjfhaskldjfhaskldj) the last characters appears after several seconds.</p>
          <p>best regards</p>

          <p>Hi, I'm using CodeCompletion every day, I don't have this experience this bug. (codeblocks source works quite well)</p>
          <p>These days, we have a CodeCompletion_refector_branch, If you would like to test, You can just build that branch.</p>
          <p>Or, you can give me the sample code, and I will do the test.</p>

          <p>As mentioned in the CB forum I have the same problem. I guess that the plugin has big problems with large libraries in the background to be parsed. Disabeling "GLOBAL includes" accelerates the plugin but with the cost of comfort. Coding with QT libraries is pure hell because the plugin is overextended with so much source in the background.</p>

          <p>Hi, I have tested again the last svn version (6817) of Codeblocks. Behaviour is significantly better, but I think, there is still a problem.</p>
          <p>My steps. Clean install of Codeblocks. Specify the wx variable.</p>
          <p>Open CB source.</p>
          <p>Wait for code parsing.</p>
          <p>Type wx and ctrl+space ... long waiting for cc window.</p>
          <p>Fast typing of some text (asdfj alskdj alsdkja; sdasdl ajsdl; kal) - there are small lags noticeable.</p>
          <p>Keep some key ('a') pressed - letters are not writen until the key is released. (this concerns big projects, like cb source, smallers are ok).</p>
          <p>I have wx source from wxPack 2.8.10. Tested on win7 and winxp. I have tested it on several computers, so i think I can't be the only one with described behaviour, or am I too sqeamish?</p>
