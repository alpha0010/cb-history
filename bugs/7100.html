          <h4>lastattacker</h4>
          <p class="lead">Wrong watch values</p>
          <p>When one has the following for example:</p>
          <p>void f1()</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>int a = 5;</p>
          <p>a += f2();</p>
          <p>}</p>
          <p>int f2()</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>char a = 'a' - 'b';</p>
          <p>return a;</p>
          <p>}</p>
          <p>Then when the debugger enters the f2 func, it doesn't see that variable 'a' in f2 as a char but as an int and also gives it totally different values. In my case I had an int in my first function and an enum in my second one. Then when I entered the 2nd func, it didn't see that variable in a different scope as an enum but as an int. Also in the same function I had another int which I initialized to 0 but when it gets initialized, it doesn't set that value to 0, only in the function where I'm having problems with my enum variable.</p>
          <p>I hope it was put clear enough.</p>

          <p>I compiled and ran the code you posted, and except that it contains at least one obvious error (which probably causes the malfunction that you observed), everything works fine.</p>

          <p>- did not get sufficient information</p>
          <p>- got no reply to an inquiry for specific information</p>
          <p>* the report is quite a bit dated of now, and</p>

          <p>- significant changes have been made to the code</p>
          <p>- no other developer could reproduce it either</p>
          <p>It is assumed that the problem does not persist and the report</p>
          <p>can be closed.</p>
          <p>If the problem reappears in future releases, please feel free to</p>
