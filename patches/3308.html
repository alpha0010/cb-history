          <p>I think that is a good option.  Do you want to work on migrating the settings?  If not, I will try to get around to it.</p>

          <p>I could not help but notice someone had started extending the C++ lexer to support wxSmith code; this patch completes it.</p>
          <p>It also adds the option to disable highlighting of wxSmith code (reverting to normal C++ syntax).</p>

          <p>OK understood and agreed - in fact I never noticed that.</p>
          <p>The patch looks fine, however, I don't like the place of the checkbox in the lexers. It applies only to the C/C++ lexer and is visible all the time.</p>
          <p>I think it should go to the editor settings, below the option to interpret #if #else #endif.</p>

          <p>Yes, I can do it... just for this and the next week my time will definitely be limited due to "real" work. If you come up with something earlier I won't kill you. ;-)</p>

          <p>The editor settings page is already quite large, and I would prefer not increasing its size further.</p>
          <p>This revision shows/hides the checkbox depending on the selected language.  Is that acceptable?</p>

          <p>I noticed something: wxSmith should always be index 99, nothing else. The reason is not to conflict with extensions of scintilla itself. Otherwise we have to adopt it everytime when a lexer is added.</p>
          <p>Also, it really is about folding - why is it named "highlightWxSmith" now? Its there to fold wxSmith code, not to highlight it.</p>

          <p>&gt; Is that acceptable?</p>
          <p>Actually not, because then we would need to transfer even more settings. I believe it simply doesn't belong there, because people don't expect it there and would not find/use it.</p>
          <p>The best way on the long run would be to re-factor the UI of the editor settings. For now, don't worry about putting this into this UI although its a bit messy...</p>

      <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading">alpha0010 2012-07-15 12:03:21</div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Due to the enum "activeFlag" in LexCPP.cxx, the index must be &lt; 64 (0x40); I choose 50 arbitrarily as a nice round number.  (Also, scintilla would have to add 27 more items to the C++ lexer before this would conflict.)</p>
          <p>I removed all references to "foldWxSmith" because it never was a working option (nor even accessible/used).  The code that folds wxSmith is actually lines 1033-1038 (1020-1025 before the patch).</p>
          <p>I could write an option to control this.</p>
          <p>I added "highlightWxSmith" so that the user could turn off the identification of wxSmith code, and just see normal C++ highlighting.</p>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>OK, I think I got a solution: In the editor settings we should add another tab like "C/C++ editor options" and in there we can move all settings from the other tabs (including the new wxSmith one) that apply only to C/C++ editors. How does that sound?</p>
