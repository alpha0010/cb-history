          <p>some people prefer using /**/ comments instead of //, because, as you all know only the first style is ANSI-C.</p>
          <p>so I added new comments types: box and stream comment, for all languages, which supports them.</p>
          <p>Stream-comments are using e.g. /* */ to comment the whole selection.</p>
          <p>Box-comments are using (mostly) the same characters, but the comment are always lines e.g.:</p>
          <p>/* foo</p>
          <p>* bar</p>
          <p>*/</p>
          <p>Further i changed the 'Comment' function to insert stream comments if there are no single line comments available in the current language. So this does also solve commenting problems with languages which don't support single line comments (like CSS).</p>
          <p>I also fixed the 'Uncomment' function to remove the stream comments and single line box comments (which actually are stream comments). But it cannot uncomment multi line box comments</p>
          <p>I hope there are no bugs in this patch :) it's my first one for C::B</p>
          <p>btw I added a new struct CommentToken to the main.h. perhaps such types should be declared somewhere else, sry if its the wrong place.</p>

          <p>oh btw i did not add keybindings to the new comment types, it would be useful but i didn't know which one would be the best. think this should be decided by someone else :)</p>
          <p>i would prefer Ctrl-Shift-V for stream comment, because its directly next to X and C which are the current hotkeys for (un)comment, and its currently not used.</p>
          <p>the box comment does not need a hotkey i think, because its only rarely used and Ctrl-Shift-B is already assigned.</p>

          <p>@mandrav for me it works, just uploaded a revised patch for the current revision(4590), i made no changes in the source code, it compiles fine, but the executable doesn't run, cause an segmentation fault occures in the AutoDetectCompilers's constructor, but that has nothing to do with my patch, it also crashes without it.</p>
          <p>i only tried if the patch worked with winxp but im very sure that it also works with linux etc. there should be no problem</p>

          <p>Will have another look. Maybe it didn't apply correctly and I didn't notice but now that you synced it to current HEAD maybe things are okay.</p>
