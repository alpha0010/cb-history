PATCH HERE: http://wxconfig.googlepages.com/add_wxconfig_support3.zip

From a PM to Yiannis, UPDATED here:

Hi! After long time, and long testing I think my wx-config windows port is ready for usage.

Here you will find: http://wxconfig.googlepages.com/add_wxconfig_support.zip
 - Patches for the current wxWidgets wizard, adding a "wx-config" mode when in Windows. I hope to remove it when everyone will be already using it.
 - New logos for the wizard, don't need to apply if you don't like.
 - wx-config.exe, the only thing really needed.
 - Patch for C::B plugin wizard (cbpluginwizard.patch and codeblocks.pc), not ready for the prime-time due to some C::B missing features (on linux also).
 - Patches for the wxSmith wizard, adding a selectable wx-config mode.


For the source, it is only a single cpp, and it's here: http://wx-config-win.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

I've put a nice webpage containing the usage documentation here: http://wxconfig.googlepages.com/

May I ask if we can:
 - Apply the patch for the wizard.
 - Put wx-config-win.cpp in trunk. byo suggested to put it in /src/tools.
 - Once you feel comfortable enough, I can adjust the C::B unix.cbp projects to use build scripts. This will mean that only one set of projects will have to be mantained finally :)

wx-config has been tested extensively with MinGW, DMC, VC makefiles and C::B projects, by at least me, eranif, and tiwag, which has given a lot of feedback.
It is being used in MinGW makefiles and C::B projects in the CodeLite project without any major problems.

Takeshi Miya
