For building a D Win32 application with Win32 resources I "modified"
the C::B settings as follows:
Within Settings >> Compiler and Debugger >> Global compiler settings
   - "Selected compiler" should be "Digital Mars D Compiler"
   - Tab "Linker" >> "Link Libraries"
     phobos.lib
	 c:\develop\d\dm\lib\advapi32.lib (optional)
	 c:\develop\d\dm\lib\shell32.lib  (optional)
   - Tab "Linker" >> "Link Libraries"
     $(PROJECT_DIR)$(PROJECT_NAME).def (Resource definition file)
   - Tab "Directories" >> "Compiler"
     C:\develop\d\dmd\src\phobos
   - Tab "Directories" >> "Linker"
	 C:\develop\d\dmd\lib
   - Tab "Directories" >> "Resource compiler"
	 C:\develop\d\dmd\include
   - Tab "Programs" >> "CompilerÂ´s installation directory"
	 C:\develop\d\dmd
   - Tab "Programs" >> "Programm Files" >> Resource compiler"
     rcc.exe (resoure compiler)
   - Tab "Other" >> "Advanced options" >> "Commands" >> "Compile Win32 resource file"
     $rescomp $file -o$resource_output -32 -r
   - Tab "Other" >> "Advanced options" >> "Commands" >> "Link object files to executable"
     $linker $exe_output $link_options $link_objects $link_resobjects $libs

Maybe this is helpfull for others.
