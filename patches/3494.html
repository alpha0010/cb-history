          <p>OK, I see.</p>
          <p>From this link: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4082972/struct-and-typedef-in-c-versus-c?rq=1">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4082972/struct-and-typedef-in-c-versus-c?rq=1</a></p>
          <p>typedef struct</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>int x;</p>
          <p>float y;</p>
          <p>} CBA;</p>
          <p>CBA is an alias to an unnamed structure, right? In your patch, you give the unnamed structure a name "struct_CBA", is that necessary?  In symbol browser tree, you click on "CBA", it will bring you to it's declaration, when you need code-completion, it will correctly show it's member.</p>
        </div>

          <p>You are writing "In your patch, you give the unnamed structure a name "struct_CBA", is that necessary?"</p>
          <p>Answer is YES!</p>
          <p>Why? Because without it current implementation of CC will always show __UnnamedStructXX instead of CBA  In the symbol browser tree, so user cannot have a clue what this structure actually is until him double-clicked it and opened corresponding source location.</p>
          <p>In fact, current implementation also gives the unnamed structure a fictitious name ( it is __UnnamedStructXX) and shows it in the browser tree, but this name is absolutely non informative.</p>
          <p>In your last example when we place mouse over variable a, b, or c we will see tooltip "ZZZ main::a", "CBA main::b" or "PPP main::c" respectively and that`s ok.</p>
          <p>Again, if we hover for example the "ZZZ" in the "ZZZ a;" declaration string, and patch is applied, we will see "typedef struct_CBA ZZZ" and this is also ok for me, because it gives some information about what this structure is. Remember "CBA" is a structure alias which usually given some informative meaning by the author.</p>
          <p>Instead, without a patch, we will see "__UnnamedStruct11 ZZZ" in the tooltip there - and that's not ok.</p>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Strictly speaking, in your example of unnamed structure with several aliases, we have several opportunities how represent it to the user.</p>
          <p>Firstly  we can display all of them as sub-entities of anonymous structure. That is exactly as Eclipse CDT behave in this situation.</p>
          <p>This is clearly the bets solution, but currently I don't see a way how to implement it in the CB.</p>
          <p>In my opinion, the best we can do right now is to choose some of these aliases and display it in the symbol browser tree - hereof this patch.</p>
          <p>At least this is much better than see in some projects tons of __UnnamedStruct and no more info.</p>

          <p>@hovercraft, thanks for the explanation. I understand the reason, I think this is a good improvement. But your patch does not works correctly when you are going to show the member of b, like:</p>
          <p>int main()</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>ZZZ a;</p>
          <p>CBA b;</p>
          <p>PPP c;</p>
          <p>b.               //&lt;----code completion does not work here once your patch applied.</p>
          <p>return 0;</p>
          <p>}</p>
          <p>This is because you manually change the Token-&gt;m_Name, this is the search key value for the Patricia tree, so they are not allowed to be changed once it is created.</p>
          <p>What I suggest is: delay struct_CBA Token creating, or delete the __UnnamedStruct1 Token, and create another one Token.</p>

          <p>The idea behind this is to update the index node without affecting the token object itself. Unfortunately, current implementation of the index classes doesn't offer an update function. So now I simply add the new node with changed name using m_TokenTree-&gt;insert and leave the old one (with the name __Unnamed..) as is. This has a disadvantage of wasting the memory with unused index entries, but still could be useful for while, because the amount of memory wasted should be relatively small.</p>
          <p>I could try to implement kind of update method in the TokenTree and it's base classes hierarchy, because I think it's good idea to have such a functionality there, but this may require a time, so I need to know your opinion before doing this.</p>

          <p>So, two roads that targets to the same Token.</p>
          <p>Normally, I think that there are many empty TokensIdxSet in the Tree, this is because some times Tokens are removed from the tree, but our searchTree can only grows (you can not remove key string in the BasicSearchTree class), so some key string point to empty TokenIdxSet.</p>
          <p>In you case, the things becomes more complicated. You know, you have occupy two TokenIdx for one Token, the former slot is actually dead. If you manually remove a Token, these slots can be reused (see the m_FreeTokens).</p>
          <p>From my point of view, I think the simple way is just: remove the dead slot in TokenIdxSet, so this looks like we have already delete a Token, but infact, we have never delete and new a Token, we just change its name. Then the dead slot can go to m_FreeTokens for reuse.</p>
          <p>The best way is as you said: the basicsearchtree can reduce it self, I event don't know how to do it, if you can do this, its better.</p>
          <p>BTW: I have some local comments about TokenTree, which I can show here or commit to svn to let you understand those classes more clear. do you?</p>

          <p>Hello!</p>
          <p>Ollydbg, after further studying the sources I now believe the problem with dead slots is seriously far-fetched. Only reducing BasicSearchTree itself makes sense. Without it we cannot achieve any sensible improvement  over my last patch variant, so I'd recommend to apply it as is for a while, because altering the BasicSearchTree may be a long enough story and it goes beyond the scope of this particular patch.</p>
          <p>1) The m_FreeTokens doesn't denote the TokenIdxSet, but rather directly specify the position of our token pointer under which it is stored in the m_Tokens. We don't have a dead slot in the m_Tokens, because it still points to our token and we does reuse it, and as such, there is nothing to put into the free token pointers list.</p>
          <p>2) We can empty the TokenIdxSet object corresponding to the previous token name ("__Unnamed.."), or even reuse it, but this will result in little if any memory saving. Most of the wasted memory will still reside in the BasicSearchTree, and the same true for the current implementation of RemoveToken procedure. For example we can use the following method:</p>
          <p>void TokenTree::rename(Token* token, const wxString&amp; newName)</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>if (!token)</p>
          <p>return;</p>
          <p>int slotNo = m_Tree.GetItemNo(token-&gt;m_Name);</p>
          <p>if (slotNo)</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>TokenIdxSet&amp; curList = m_Tree.GetItemAtPos(slotNo);</p>
          <p>// The previous name index path of the token will still exist, as well as its TokenIdxSet slot,</p>
          <p>// but this slot will be empty and as result will lead to nothing.</p>
          <p>// This is the same sing the RemoveToken procedure dues.</p>
          <p>curList.erase(token-&gt;m_Index);</p>
          <p>// Actually we can save some additional memory by reusing this slot,</p>
          <p>// this can be easily implemented on the BasicSearchTree level,</p>
          <p>// but is it worth the efforts? Most of the memory will still be wasted by the BasicSearchTree itself.</p>
          <p>};</p>
          <p>token-&gt;m_Name = newName;</p>
          <p>AddToken(token, token-&gt;m_Index);</p>

          <p>Hi, hovercraft, I agree with you.</p>
          <p>What I want is to let the basicsearchtree have some "delete" functions.</p>
          <p>I have take some time to read/debug the tree related code, I see that there are many things coupled in the basic search tree.</p>
          <p>First, tree node is reference by index, I think this is OK.</p>
          <p>Second, all the node have an item-map, which is a map of (depth-&gt;itemno). For example, we have a tree:</p>
          <p>*   - "" (0)</p>
          <p>*         \- "p" (4)</p>
          <p>*                 +- "hysi" (2)</p>

          <p>Now, the node "hysi" (2) can have up to four elements, such as:</p>
          <p>depth -&gt; (actually string) -&gt; itemno</p>
          <p>5        -&gt;  "ph"                  -&gt;  3</p>

          <p>8        -&gt;  "physi"               -&gt;7</p>
          <p>Here, the itemno is type of "size_t", and itemno is in-fact an index of the m_Points in BasicSearchTree class.</p>
          <p>Also, itemno is also the index of the general type T in std::vector&lt;T&gt; m_Items in class template &lt;class T&gt; class SearchTree.</p>
          <p>In CC, the T is typedef std::set&lt; int,    std::less&lt;int&gt;    &gt; TokenIdxSet;</p>
          <p>Here, I think both BasicSearchTree::m_Points and SearchTree::m_Items are useless, if we directly hold the information in SearchTreeNode::m_Items.</p>
          <p>This means in the SearchTreeNode::m_Items (item map of each node), we can have:</p>
          <p>depth -&gt; (actually string) -&gt; T(TokenIdxSet)</p>
          <p>5        -&gt;  "ph"                  -&gt;  TokenIdxSet of all the Token which has the name "ph"</p>
          <p>6        -&gt;  "phy"                -&gt;  TokenIdxSet of all the Token which has the name "phy"</p>
          <p>7        -&gt;  "phys"              -&gt;  TokenIdxSet of all the Token which has the name "phys"</p>
          <p>8        -&gt;  "physi"             -&gt;  TokenIdxSet of all the Token which has the name "physi"</p>
          <p>Now, in this way, remove/delete an key(string) in the basicsearchtree is much easier.</p>
          <p>We just remove some tree nodes, and as Nodes are stored in typedef std::vector&lt;SearchTreeNode*&gt; SearchTreeNodesArray, we may have some slot left empty in the vector, but that's not a problem, because there empty slot (node index) can be reused later.</p>
          <p>When you want to remove a Token, you just find the T(TokenIdxSet), and remove the index of the Token in the TokenIdxSet, if the set becomes empty (e.g. index set for string "ph" becomes empty).  then there is no such Token named "ph", so there is no need to keep this element in the SearchTreeNode::m_Items, we can directly remove this element in the map.</p>
          <p>If the SearchTreeNode::m_Items becomes empty, we know that this node can be deleted.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure my analysis is good, comments are welcome.</p>

          <p>Yes, I agree, deletion of the key may affect performance, if we do it often. This surely is a subject to the usual performance/memory trade-off. May be we should not do anything in this respect at all, if the memory constraints not so important.</p>
          <p>What I did in this patch - I found a way to add aliases for some token names if we need so. In principle, anonymous tokens can benefit from it, would it be possible to display several aliases of a token in the browser tree in the future. I.e. we can refer the anonymous object both as __UnnamedStruct and as struct_blabla for example.</p>

          <p>1) It depends on what we prefer. The TokenTree::rename method terminates an "__Unnamed.." index path, makes it point to nothing.  Whereas variant as of 2013-10-09 leave the "__Unnamed.." index path operational (implicitly produces an alias). And finally I just made an explicit void TokenTree::alias(Token* token, const wxString&amp; newName) and corresponding size_t BasicSearchTree::alias(const wxString&amp; s, size_t itemno) methods. I'd prefer the explicit method, despite it introduces more changes than others.</p>

          <p>Oh, I can confirm this is a bug.</p>
          <p>If you have such code:</p>
          <p>struct</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>int x;</p>
          <p>float y;</p>

          <p>int main (int argc, char** argv)</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>}</p>
          <p>Once you edit this code, and press Save button, the parser runs again, and look at the symbol tree, the __UnnamedStructXXX will increase by one. I also see the dumped basicsearchtree, and it is growing.</p>
          <p>This is a serious bug, and should be fixed. I file a bug report here: <a href="../bugs/19186.html">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=19186&amp;group_id=5358</a></p>

          <p>I personally like the way "void TokenTree::rename(Token* token, const wxString&amp; newName)" better. See the reasons below:</p>
          <p>Obf(another dev) has the similar option, see: <a href="http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/topic,18542.msg126892.html#msg126892,">http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/topic,18542.msg126892.html#msg126892,</a> so we expect to remove the ugly __UnnamedStructXXXXXXX names, although it looks like it's hard to remove the ugly name in the basicsearchtree.</p>
          <p>I think people will get confused when they see two steps (in your patch of 2013-Oct-09)</p>
          <p>1, change a Token's name.</p>
          <p>2, re-insert the Token to the tree. (this in-fact cause two roads go to the same Token)</p>
          <p>I think it is much clean/better that we have a explicit function named "RenameToken()", that is we break the old road as the name really changes, and construct the new road.</p>
          <p>What's your opinion? If it is OK, would you mind to file the new patch? Thanks for the contribution.</p>

          <p>Yes, I also noticed that second parameter in AddToken should be indeed the Toke::m_Index, but may be somewhere mismatched with file index. I had in mind to check it more closely, but you outran me :)</p>

          <p>I think generally the function in your patch: RenameToken(Token* token, const wxString&amp; newName)  need to function:</p>
          <p>AddToken(token, token-&gt;m_Index);</p>
          <p>Here, the first argument is the Token pointer</p>
          <p>the second argument is the forced index, which means we want to re-used the slot in the std::vector&lt;Token*&gt;. In-fact in most cases AddToken function was called like AddToken(token, -1), this means the token will take one new slot in the std::vector&lt;Token*&gt; (or an empty slot).</p>
          <p>The more simple way is we just add the token-&gt;m_Index to a TokenIdxSet which is mapped by the newName.</p>

          <p>I found the reason.</p>
          <p>I have two cpp file in one project. Both cpp file contain such code:</p>
          <p>struct</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>int x;</p>
          <p>float y;</p>
          <p>} abc;</p>
          <p>So, originally, the token name is: __UnnamedStruct6_0 and __UnnamedStruct7_0, note 6 and 7 are file index which means they are in different source files.</p>
          <p>But when they get renamed, we get the same token name: struct_abc. So, finally, I get abc. which show two x and two y in suggesting list.</p>
          <p>Because abc's type is: struct_abc, but we have two tokens for both cpp files.</p>
          <p>I don't think this is a big problem (it looks like gcc can compile such code)</p>
          <p>Maybe, we can change the token name to "struct6_abc" and  "struct7_abc" to solve this problem?</p>

          <p>Well, in the copy of source where I originally created this patch, just passing m_LastParent to the TokenExists method surprisingly could lead to incorrect result: no token found. That's why this block was inserted. In the current sources I cannot reproduce this situation. May be the original source copy has been broken or just too outdated.</p>

          <p>I just thought anonymous object inside classes (and other nested cases) may be subject to further investigation and would be better to leave them as is for a while.</p>
          <p>For example if we add a global</p>

          <p>QUOTE: I just thought anonymous object inside classes (and other nested cases) may be subject to further investigation and would be better to leave them as is for a while.</p>
          <p>Well, I think it anonymous class inside class can be solve by such method:</p>
          <p>Suppose we have the following code snippet in either class and global space</p>
          <p>struct</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>int x;</p>
          <p>float y;</p>
          <p>} abcd;</p>
          <p>Normally, we will get two type tokens: _UnnamedStruct2_3 (in class) and _UnnamedStruct2_3 (in global namespace)</p>
          <p>Now, with the rename method, we will get:</p>
          <p>_UnnamedStruct2_3_abcd (in class) and _UnnamedStruct2_3_abcd (in global namespace)</p>
          <p>OR</p>
          <p>struct2_3_abcd (in class) and struct2_3_abcd (in global namespace)</p>
          <p>We put the alias after the the token index.</p>
          <p>What do you think about this method?</p>

          <p>Ok - let's do this way.</p>
          <p>And one more point: would it be the right idea to introduce into the Token class some flag or something to mark anonymous tokens to be able distinguish them reliably? For example in the future different gui parts (e.g. plugins) can rely on this flag if they want to change the way such objects been represented to the end user. Maybe a simple public boolean variable Token::m_IsUnnamed?</p>

          <p>Hi, hovercraft, thanks. Yes, it is possible to add another bool variable in the Token.</p>
          <p>But currently there are two many bool variables in the Token class, this make Token class a lot bigger, I would think change them to bit field, something like:</p>
          <p>class Token</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>unsigned int  isTemplate : 1;</p>
          <p>unsigned int  isConst      : 1;</p>
          <p>unsigned int  isUnnamed: 1;</p>
          <p>......</p>
          <p>};</p>
          <p>But not easy, because there are too many places which use those bools.</p>
          <p>I have some new idea when I read your comments, is it possible to leave the Token name unchanged (_UnnamedStructXX_YYY), and later when we want to show them, just change the string in the GUI by checking the Token's name(I mean: avoiding adding the isUnnamed bit field or bool variable, just check the name)?</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default">

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>This is possible of course.  But having a boolean or bit field much better. This way we can avoid string compare operation every time we need to know object kind, which in turn usually should refer the g_UnnamedSymbol constant..</p>
          <p>We can add a boolean as temporary measure and make it hidden (protected or private), but add the public interface function to read its value as boolean.</p>
          <p>Later we can redesign the code so internally these values will be represented as bit fields without changing class interface! We can try do this with other boolean members I believe - maybe even without changing the consuming code.</p>
          <p>I just afraid, if we will switch to redesign gui right now, wouldn't it leave us for a long period yet with what we have?</p>

          <p>std::map&lt;wxString, wxString&gt; m_TemplateMap;</p>
          <p>wxString                     m_TemplateAlias;   // alias for templates, e.g. template T1 T2;</p>
          <p>void*                        m_UserData;        // custom user-data (the classbrowser expects it to be a pointer to a cbProject)</p>
          <p>protected:</p>
          <p>TokenTree*                   m_TokenTree;       // a pointer to TokenTree</p>
          <p>size_t                       m_Ticket;          // This is used in classbrowser to avoid duplication</p>
          <p>};</p>
          <p>You see, there are already a lot of bool variables. Also, there are some variables which only used for special kind of Token type. For example, m_TemplateMap, which is only for a class template specification, m_IsOperator is only used for functions.</p>
          <p>So, maybe, a better way is: create a TokenBase class, which implement all the basic interface, then any special Token kind like functions, classes, structs...... should all be derived from the TokenBase, and have their own member variables, we can still hold all the pointers in the vector like std::vector&lt;TokenBase*&gt;.</p>
          <p>But I think it is not easy/soon to implement this.</p>
          <p>Now, lets return to our topic, if you add a bool variable m_IsUnnamed, what should we do?</p>
          <p>Change the code:</p>
          <p>if (m_Str.Contains(_T("Union")))</p>
          <p>m_Str = _T("union");</p>
          <p>else if (m_Str.Contains(_T("Struct")))</p>
          <p>m_Str = _T("struct");</p>
          <p>else</p>
          <p>m_Str = _T("tag");</p>
          <p>to something like:</p>
          <p>Token* typeToken= TokenExists(m_Str, m_LastParent, typeMask);</p>
          <p>typeToken-&gt;IsUnnamed == true;</p>
          <p>m_Str =...</p>
          <p>???</p>
          <p>Any other changes???</p>

          <p>Never mind. I just thought it is good idea to finish this patch first. And then we can start  re-design the user interface and related redesign of the Token class.</p>
          <p>Adding the m_IsUnnamed member doesn't influence the way how we would rename anonymous tokens but gives us possibility to distinguish them easily afterwards.</p>

          <p>Hi, hovercraft, thanks.</p>
          <p>In-fact, I'm not sure what is the way to do such refactoring.  When I was not a C::B developer, I remember that I sent several patches to Morten(C::B developer), and he maintained a SVN branch, and applied my patches on the branch. Currently I don't know how to maintain a SVN branch(my knowledge of SVN branch/merge is quite limited), maybe another approach is we can work on a git clone, OBF(C::B developer) has a git clone of C::B source on github, using git for branch works much simpler.</p>
          <p>When I looked at the Token class, I see there are about five or six bool variables, so if we convert them to bit field, we can save about five or four bytes, this looks not much appealing. Since some member variables are only for specific kind of Tokens, such as: m_TemplateMap. I still think we can create a base class like TokenBase, and define the common interface(by virtual functions), and create many kind of specific Tokens by inheritance, what do you think about this method?  Maybe, we can discuss this on C::B forum.</p>
