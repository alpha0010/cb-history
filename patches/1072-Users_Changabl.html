          <p>Hello!</p>
          <p>Great teamwork here :D</p>
          <p>But there are two things I don't understand:</p>
          <p>1) Why is the checkbox located on the General Settings tab? I think it belongs to the "Gutter, margins and caret" page.</p>
          <p>2) This patch makes sethjackson's patch completely unnecessary. It would be better to combine them in a way like this:</p>
          <p>If dynamic margin is not checked, the value of the box would be used, and this is defaulted to 48, so everyone will be happy ;)</p>
          <p>If it is checked, the type-in field could be disabled.</p>
          <p>Regards, Defender</p>

          <p>I can't seem to find the patch by sethjackson you are talking about, but I will try to find it.</p>
          <p>1)You are right, this really should go in "Gutter, margins and caret", that was just a mistake on my part.</p>
          <p>2) You are saying there should be two settings here :  One is a text box (or spinner), that is only valid (you can grey it out) if you don't have dynamic checked.  I not have it use raw pixels, just tell it how many numbers you want to show.  GetTextExtent, can take care of the rest.</p>

          <p>Sethjackson's patch (#1065) was applied as revision 2485, you should just be able to update your working copy and then make the needed changes.  For now, I would just post the updated patch somewhere the forum so it can be tested before I update this patch.</p>
