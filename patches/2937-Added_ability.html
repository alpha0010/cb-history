          <p>It may sounds strange, but it is correct behavior. This is just invalid configuration. I do not wish to introduce artificial limits. In all regular scenarios users setup reasonable configurations. Probably some warning may be produced.</p>

          <p>Here is an issue:</p>
          <p>If I compile a dynamic library and want to automatically create the prefix and extension and have enabled "create import library" and "create def file" and my output file does look like: "MyLib" the def file will overwrite the include library without any warning. You'll notice a linker error that "the format could be recognised" when you try to link against the import lib.</p>

          <p>Please allow me an objection hereby:</p>
          <p>I doubt that this will be considered as "correct".</p>
          <p>If I want to have C::B take care about prefix and suffix and provide just the (middle) name compilation should really work. Otherwise the checkboxes simply don't do what a users intention is.</p>
          <p>BTW: We had discussed these issues already a long time in the past. This must be bullet (and fool) proof.</p>

          <p>I misunderstand you. I thought you were taking about case when both checkboxes are unchecked. Try it now, I fixed that error.</p>

          <p>What do you mean by "review"? I don't see the patch has updated since March. If you mean to review your last update - don't worry, I did. I still have it applied in my local copy and use it in daily environment for testing. So far I have no complaints, otherwise I'll post here, of course.</p>
          <p>I tried to reproduce the issue you said you've fixed and indeed it seems not to happen anymore.</p>
          <p>However, Linux/Mac testing is missing which is a must! Hence I don't have time for this atm. As you are surely aware we are in feature freeze, so this won't make it into the release. But after that I am open for public testing/discussion through nightlies (if needed).</p>

          <p>Yes, patch was not update because it should be complete in the way it is now. I had asked to clarify the status of this patch.</p>
          <p>I was not aware about feature freeze. I was also not aware about the fact that you are using this path on daily basis. I'm pleased that it works for you.</p>
          <p>I will be happy to see it in nightlies after release. Since I have no daily access to Mac nor Linux.</p>
          <p>Thanks for response.</p>
