          <p>Yes; I think it makes much more sense to include this small 3% of the Boost library that is used, rather than force the download of the entire library simply to build the Nassi Shneiderman plugin.</p>
          <p>I believe this build convenience is a similar idea to that of, for example, the AStyle plugin.</p>
          <p>I only patched the Windows build system, however I would assume the Linux build system could be patched to use these files as well without too much hassle.</p>

          <p>Putting boost files in our svn?</p>

          <p>I like the idea, but if its Windows only, it makes no sense to bundle it. Resolving the dependency on Windows is as easy as to extract a 7z archive (the boost one). On Linux this is different. So either this works on all platforms, or it doesn't really bring a benefit other that stealing SVN bandwidth. :-(</p>

          <p>Although downloading and extracting the full boost archive is easy, it is very time (and somewhat space) consuming (at least for me), which is why I proposed this.  However, you are right, this patch should be postponed consideration until I (or someone else) has a chance to complete and test it on Linux platforms (I am fairly certain it contains all - or nearly all - the correct files already, only the .cbp and Makefile.am must be patched).</p>

          <p>Keep in mind that most distributions don't like the bundling of common libraries in a source of a project. They feel this is a bad practice (security issues, code duplication, etc).</p>
          <p>I don't like it, too.</p>
          <p>The way to go with this one is to provide a downloadable archive with all the files pre-build or in build-able configuration, so users like you can save time.</p>
          <p>What is the problem of just downloading a 50mb file and then extracting it? You have to do this once.</p>
          <p>Or just disable the build of the only plugin requiring it? Do you use it at all?</p>

          <p>It would be a simple matter for me to instead provide an archive of this portion of Boost, however, I am unsure of where I would store it for others to find/make use of.  I could put it on my SkyDrive, but that looks rather unofficial, likely causing many of the "would-be time saver users" to instead opt for the official version (negating any benefit).</p>
          <p>Would you suggest I abandon this idea?</p>
          <p>Do you have a more-official looking location the archive could be hosted at?</p>
          <p>(With respects to my problem with Boost - as you mentioned, I like to save time.  I also dislike that a library as large as Boost cannot be easily decoupled, so that one only needs carry around the parts they use.  But this is just my opinion.)</p>
