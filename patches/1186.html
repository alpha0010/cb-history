          <p>This bug crashed into sdk/projectmanager.cpp +996</p>
          <p>The patch removes ProjectManager::pTopEditor and references to it.</p>
          <p>ProjectManager::SetTopEditor(...)</p>
          <p>ProjectManager::GetTopEditor()</p>
          <p>Changes/breaks sdk-interface =&gt; forces lots of recompilation!</p>
          <p>But it seemed the only sensible way to fix this bug, because IMO no references to Editor-Windows should be held anywhere outside of EditorManager, if I got that pattern right.</p>
          <p>There were no dependent references to this interface anyway.</p>
          <p>Awaiting your comments!</p>
          <p>Cheers,</p>

          <p>I believe there is an easier and cleaner solution:</p>
          <p>cbEditor::~cbEditor()</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>/* ... */</p>
          <p>ProjectManager *pm = Manager::Get()-&gt;GetProjectManager();</p>
          <p>if(pm)</p>
          <p>pm-&gt;SetTopEditor(0);</p>
          <p>delete m_pData;</p>

          <p>Please try revision 2671. On my machine, this fixes the problem.</p>

          <p>Yes, this looks easier, but I am not so sure that it is also cleaner. I have a few arguments against this solution:</p>
          <p>Now the cbEditor needs to know about a ProjectManager that it is some part of. Doesn't feel right to me: It shouldn't need to know that.</p>
          <p>pTopEditor points to EditorBase, not to the derived cbEditor.   Given a future alternative implementation of this interface the same problem would rise again.</p>
          <p>pTopEditor and its Set/Get-Methods have a very questionable reason for being there, but  I am not into it enough to really judge this.</p>
          <p>As I understand the EditorManager and all the other Manager-Gizmos around, they are there telling us: "Hey, we take care about this sh** and you need not be concerned about our business. If you need to know about the Editors around, ask the EditorManager, gotcha?"</p>
          <p>If that is so, then holding a private reference to some instance of an Editor anywhere breaks this design.</p>
          <p>In your solution pTopEditor will be zeroed in case _any_ of the open editors is destroyed. On the other hand it is only set once int cbProject::LoadLayout().</p>
          <p>Then Activate() is already called there on the last open Editor-Panel, the call that crashes on the meanwhile invalidated pointer in ProjectManager - fatal and redundant. And right this Activate()-Call is the only use of pTopEditor within the ProjectManager.</p>
          <p>So my favourite easy and simple solution is just dropping the line that causes the crash. It's not needed anyway (well, so it seems).</p>
          <p>The whole rest of my arguments could be postponed then.</p>
          <p>What about this?</p>
          <p>Greetz,</p>
          <p>Björn</p>

          <p>&gt;Now the cbEditor needs to know about a ProjectManager...</p>
          <p>&gt;pTopEditor points to EditorBase</p>
          <p>The former is the most normal thing, happens everywhere throughout the code, the latter is technically true, but no problem, putting the same instruction into EditorBase instead is a fiffy (should have done that anyway).</p>
          <p>However, you are certainly right insofar as the top editor does no longer serve any real purpose. It is a relict none of us remembers what it was once good for, so it can as well be entirely removed. :)</p>

          <p>All right, then I will update the patch to the latest revision and remove that thing.</p>
          <p>I think the info on "What was the last editor/file open on top with this project" could go into cbProject, if anybody has some use for it.</p>
          <p>By the way I feel a bit silly throwing such big arguments at you for such a rather small issue.</p>
          <p>Well,. it's my first dig on this project, so I am just slightly over-motivated. ;-) Hope you don't mind.</p>
