          <p class="lead">Practical enhancements (big projects)</p>
          <pre class="pre-scrollable">
Hello,


I'm currently working on a big project (8130 files, ca.
900 000 lines of code) and I use Code::Blocks (SVN
4523) because I like it better than other IDE's.
Currently I am updating nearly each day from SVN and
compile it for my daily use.

Some small enhancements would ease the life for such
projects:
- default sizes of selection windows are too small.
Especially file selection windows are too small, since
we have an entire code-tree with lots of
subdirectories. Quick selection of a file with Alt-G
too (which is the major cause for this post). If they
can be set from some resource files (or there are some
values in source files which could be changed), I would
be glad if somebody pointed me to the right direction.
- When selecting right click-&gt;insert-&gt;class method
declaration/implementation, I get all classes in the
selection on the left side of the window. A quick
filter (like on the selection with Alt-G) would be very
nice, since I have a LOT of classes. By the way, the
default size of this window is another one which is too
small. 
- The function Swap Header/Source doesn't work
correctly. We have the enforcement to use .H and .C
(rather .h and .cpp) for C++ filenames (I configured it
in the preferences), but on switching I am always told,
that the corresponding file could not be found and if I
would like to create a new one. I don't know if this
feature depends on the directory or the file-extension
(or both) but it would be more usefull.
- As already posted in another feature request, it
would be cool to have different directories selectable
for header and sources in the class wizard. I did a
quick hack and implemented this for my use, if somebody
is interested, maybe I can check this in.


These are some small and rather minor issues, but for
me they would increase the usability of Code::Blocks a lot.

In the moment I don't have that much time, otherwise I
would dig into the code and fix these things myself,
but if somebody points me to the right directions where
to apply some fixes, I would greatly appreciate this
and definitly do it myself, if it doesn't cost that
much time (I'm in a rather tight schedule).


lg,
Michael

PS: A small side note on compilation process of
Code::Blocks itself: I currently use SuSE Linux
Enterprise Server 9 with gcc 3.3.3 and a self-compiled
gtk2/wxWidgets (since the gtk needed for Code::Blocks
is not present on the system), because of the strong
requirements of the software project, I am currently
working on. 
On this system when compiling I had to do some fixes to
get Code::Blocks to compile, mainly to add some
#includes for wxWidgets, when some classes were not
found and some small code changes.
I don't know if this would be interesting to others too.
