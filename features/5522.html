          <p class="lead">CC: Enter to jump out of parentheses</p>
          <p>It would be great if after an auto-complete resulting in  the cursor being surrounded by parentheses or  followed by one, pressing Enter would cause the  cursor to jump after the nearest closing parenthesis.</p>
          <p>That said it doesn't have to be necessarily after an  auto-complete, it just happens that this situation  generally occurs after one.</p>
          <p>A good example of this behavior exists in eclipse if I  remember correctly.</p>
          <p>Applying this behavior to brackets might be  questionable but it would certainly be useful for  parentheses and square brackets.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, I tested more thoroughly, and didn't even notice that CB was smart enough to place the cursor outside the parenthesis when a call does not need arguments.</p>
          <p>In this case that simplify things, I'm going to try and clarify what I was suggesting:</p>
          <p>-"|" represents the cursor -"*" represents any character</p>
          <p>if function takes arguments but they're not mandatory or I decide to fill them later: *******(|) -&gt; enter -&gt; *******()|</p>
          <p>if I typed my arguments: *******(***,***,****|) -&gt; enter -&gt; *******(***,***,****)| but if not *******(***,***,|) -&gt; enter -&gt; *******(***,***,\n |)</p>
          <p>I hope this clarifies what I was looking for, it's sort of like an "I'm done here" key.</p>
          <p>Depending on your keyboard layout you might not really see the point although it can be useful for everybody even if your layout isn't awkward, but some people wish they could have been there when they decided it so they could scream "are you nuts ?!". XD</p>

          <p>Thanks, it is more clear now. You can use the TAB key to achieve this.</p>
          <p>*******(***,***,****|) -&gt; enter TAB key -&gt; *******(***,***,****)|</p>
          <p>This used to work, but I just find that it does not works in the nightly build rev7932, so sure how it cause this regression.</p>

          <p>I'm using the nightly rev7932, so it was working before ? I tried a few builds up to rev6992 and rev6283 (v10.05)  and it didn't work in any of them. I find it odd that it would take so much time to spot (2yrs),  I'm sure some people used this as much as the ";" key. Maybe a library causing mischiefs?</p>

          <p>I'm sure it works before, because I even it is implemented by Loaden, and it is called Smart tab. You can see there is a member variable: m_tabSmartJump in the file: cb_trunk\src\include\cbstyledtextctrl.h</p>
          <p>I'm currently busy so hope someone can investigate this.</p>

          <p>OK, after some debugging under GDB, I can see that the smart jump works Ok.</p>
          <p>Note: the smart jump is enabled automatically when you press a "(". After that, the right ")" will be jumped over when you press the TAB key. Also, the ")" will have the different color.</p>
          <p>Comments are welcome.</p>

          <p>Odd, I can't seem to get it working, is there anything that  could indirectly disable it?</p>
          <p>Is typing "(" first mandatory for it to work or is it enabled  as long as my cursor is inside parenthesis? (eg.: after an auto-complete)</p>

          <p>I'm not sure why it does not works on your system, can you possible to debug it? (debug C::B under C::B, without this I can't give your more help)</p>
          <p>I can't see there is an option to enable or disable this feature. So, it is always enabled.</p>

          <p>Just a quick message to say that I setup a build for testing,   and am on it. I couldn't get the code dealing with smartTab into scope to  debug it yet, even though it's supposed to run pretty  frequently. I suspect the fact that I only had little time and placed the  breakpoints in a hurry to be the problem.</p>
          <p>I'll try again when I have enough time to actually focus on  it.</p>
