          <p class="lead">Vertical split pane as columns.</p>
          <p>This is a formal request for something I mentioned in the forum the day split panes were added. It may also be related to feature request 002127 (multipane editing).</p>
          <p>This request is for an option in vertical split mode whereby scrolling of both panes is linked: when line 50 is at the bottom of the left pane then line 51 is at the top of the right pane. This enables natural and continuous viewing of twice as many adjacent lines of code scrolling at once.</p>
          <p>Consequences of this option may include:</p>
          <p>- since this feature only makes sense in vertical split mode then maybe the 'split view' menu would present one more choice in addition to horizontal and vertical, the third one being "columnar" which is like vertical split but with linked scrolling;</p>
          <p>- only one scroll bar becomes necessary so if this is found convenient then the left one can be removed to regain a little display width (though leaving it there does no harm);</p>
          <p>- any font or other display change in one pane should carry to the other pane as well.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

          <p>Another consequence of this linkage is that the left pane must be allowed to scroll past the first line and the right pane must be allowed to scroll past the last line. This is because the selection (highlighting) of any code section must remain possible from either pane. For example, selecting from a line in the left pane down to the last line in the source file causes the right pane to scroll past the last line and become empty as all content has now scrolled completely to the left pane. Conversely, selecting from a line in the right pane up to the first line in the source file causes the left pane to scroll empty so that all content is now in the right pane for selection. So the "active" pane acts as if it were alone and the other pane follows, exceeding the usual scroll limits if necessary.</p>
