          <p class="lead">File commands in tabs and project tree</p>
          <p>1. Add rename and delete (as in delete from the  disk, not just the project) commands to the context  menu for editor file tabs and files in the project tree.</p>
          <p>2. Add open project folder and open location  commands to the context menu in the project tree  to open the folder the project file is in.</p>
          <p>3. Add an option to move files added to the project  to the project folder.</p>
          <p>4. Add a target picker dialog to the "Build and run"  command</p>

          <p>#1 Partially implemented. You can rename files. #2 Why? #3 Why? #4 Already implemented (Look for "Build target: " in the                    toolbar).</p>
          <p>I think it is a bad idea to add more functunality to the editor tabs.</p>
          <p>Next time please submit ONE feature request at a time (Submitting four seperate requests is better). :D</p>
          <p>Please try a nightly build from here. Many bugs have been fixed, and many features have been added....</p>

          <p>#1 An IDE should not do such things. Moving, deleting, and renaming (possibly overwriting) files behind the scenes is evil. Nevertheless, renaming project files is implemented because it is immensely useful. Renaming a file is not uncommon, and having to manually remove and re-add it from/to the project each time in addition is a pain. Deleting files, however, will not be supported. Deleting files behind the scenes brings great evil. Yiannis does not want it, and I don't either.</p>
          <p>#2 Although this may be useful in some situations, we sadly cannot implement it in a cross-platform way. It is quite trivial to do under Windows, but you have no guarantees on how the "Explorer analogon" is called under Linux or other systems, it may be Nautilus or KFM, or whatever (does MacOS still call it Finder...?).</p>
          <p>#3 That does not make sense to me, files should be consciously arranged by a human, not secretly by some software. The same as for deleting files applies.</p>
          <p>#4 See Seth Jackson's reply.</p>

          <p>1. Meant only when the user specifically asked for a file  to be renamed/deleted by selecting that option in a  menu.  If renaming is implemented, I can't find it (I'm  using the May 14th build on Windows XP and Kubuntu). 2. Support on one platform is better  than none at all...  if there is no cross platform method to open folders in  the libraries you're using, is there instead a way to  detect common Explorer style programs on Linux and  add "Open in Nautilus" or "Open in Konquerer" options  (when detected) to project folders? 3. Nevermind.  The idea was to make it easier to  package a source code library with your project by  copying the source files into the main project, but  having multiple copies of a source file floating around  would be a pain when you need to keep them all up to  date. 4. My mistake, it's working now.</p>
