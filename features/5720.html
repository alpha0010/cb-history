          <p class="lead">Support for Objective-C on Mac</p>
          <p>Support for Objective-C on Mac</p>
          <p>I have recently set up CodeBlocks 13.12 on Mac to work with Objective-C source. No program changes were necessary. With a few changes it could be done automatically. Without Objective-C there is limited capability on the Mac.</p>
          <p>Objective-C can also be used on Windows or Linux with the addition of the GNUstep package. But it only works with compilers that support Objective-C. The ones I know of outside of Mac are MinGW and GCC. And the Objective-C compiler package must be installed on these. I don’t know how useful it would be outside of Mac.</p>
          <p>The following describes the changes that were necessary to set up Objective-C on Mac. The LLVM Clang compiler was used. I assume it would work the same with GCC.</p>
          <p>After creating a project containing Objective-C source code, I tried to open an Objective-C file in CodeBlocks. It didn’t recognize the file extension of “.m”. I selected “Open it inside the CodeBlocks editor”. Then right clicked on the Objective-C file name and selected “Properties”. Check the “Compile file” and “Link file” options. This is all that was needed to compile and run the program.</p>
          <p>The syntax highlighting needs to be changed also. Objective-C has an “.m” extension which is currently assigned to Matlib. It must be removed from Matlib and added to Objective-C. Then the syntax highlighting seemed to be the same as C/C++ without any changes.</p>
          <p>This is all that was necessary to use Objective-C on the Mac.</p>
          <p>There seems to be quite a few people who don’t like Xcode. It would be good to have a cross-platform IDE like CodeBlocks that could be used with Objective-C on the Mac. And it looks like the changes would not be extensive.</p>
