          <p>hi</p>
          <p>ty for the software good job; all that's missing is inline help and a faster load time(in minimal mode it loads fast, but with all plugins its quite slow).</p>
          <p>i would like to suggest a small feature if you don't mind on the left of the recent project/file list there's a recycle icon; can you attach a script to that so it can erase all files/project (option in settings to chose between files/project/both) or separate recycle icons for project and files.</p>
          <p>ps: about faster loading times; i have noticed that every time the editor starts it reads plugin folder(all plugins) even though some/all plugins are disabled; this counting for the slow load times - may i suggest a button inside config ... reread plugin folder? or popup suggesting plugin folder size changed &gt; reread plugin...</p>

          <p>Yes, even a plugin is disabled, it is read. The simple solution is just delete the plugin. E.g. delete the plugin dll if you use Windows.</p>

          <p>about plugins: you are right, the simplest solution is just to delete them; but that's management outside the interface; i did that; but i'd like to manage them inside interface without performance issues; i think a refresh plugins button is most convenient(new/added plugins to be deactivated on refresh); to read plugins on every start is not necessary/deactivated plugins, pointless</p>
          <p>about recent project/files: still pending... i'd like to clean them from start page..with 1 button(that recycle icon is fine.. add to it this functionality pls)</p>

          <p>About plugins, did you see: Uninstall button from plugin manager dialog? By click this, you can delete all the plugin related files. Also, there is an install button which can install any new plugins.</p>

          <p>sow it now:); i focused on the fact that C::B reads plugins that are disabled and didn't pay attention on install/uninstall/export functions;</p>
          <p>well i guess plugin part is ok; if you are interested in some cosmetic functionality of it i have some suggestions  - i can always delete/copy dll's to plugin folder with the OS interface   - i'd like to activate/deactivate(usable/not by C::B) them with 1 button so only 2 buttons managing plugins, eneble/disable and read/refresh plugin folder; i'd really like to lose plugin folder read at start function its slowing program start; besides i don't change plugins on daily bases</p>
