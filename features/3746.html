          <p class="lead">Integration in eclipse as a workbench</p>
          <p>It would be a great addition if codeblocks comes  out also as a workbench that is pluggable into  eclipse, that way it could benefit users that know  how eclipse looks and feels.  The developers can then use all the features from  the eclipse platform to enhance CodeBlocks and  provide updates.</p>
          <p>Always wanted to have an C/C++ IDE that is ready  to start but CodeBlocks doesn't fits into eclipse And the eclipse CDT tools come without a compiler  which makes it difficult to find and install a good  working system from that.</p>
          <p>Especially for newbies.  By integrating CodeBlocks into Eclipse could pave  the way for a ready to go C++ IDE and complete  suite to work with. CodeBlocks can also gain users  from eclipse that would try it out and otherwise  never heard of CodeBlocks.</p>

          <p>Are you sure this is possible?? Code::Blocks is written with C++ and Eclipse is written with Java. They belong to different domain.</p>
          <p>Apart from that C::B has been written to be a Full-fledged IDE, Not as a plugin/sub-project of another IDE. We don't have any such plan to integrate C::B with another IDE. That is not our goal.</p>

          <p>Eclipse is only a framework, it is totally not that  CodeBlocks will be a Sub-Project of it.  This is not for anything soon, first codeblocks has to be  completed and then there is time for looking at things  like this.</p>
          <p>Take a look at this, very interesting because it's a big  project written in C/C++ that is made into a plugin for  eclipse.</p>
          <p>OpenOffice in Eclipse!!!</p>
          <p>Link to eclipse plugin central at the project: <a href="http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/Web_Links-index-">http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/Web_Links-index-</a> req-viewlink-cid-484.html</p>
          <p>Link to homepage of the project: <a href="http://ubion.ion.ag/solutions/003officeintegrationeditor">http://ubion.ion.ag/solutions/003officeintegrationeditor</a></p>
          <p>So it is possible to make a plugin in eclipse of big  projects who are written in C/C++</p>
