          <p class="lead">Custom command for "Run" option</p>
          <p>Hi!</p>
          <p>Would it be possible to add a possibility to specify  custom command which would be run in case of "Build- &gt; Run" (or Ctrl+F10)? Or maybe to extend "Make"  commands (I would appreciate adding a command for  "Run" which would be similar to e.g. "Build project/ target").</p>

          <p>I'll try to make it clear.. When I hit the Build button my  project is compiled. I can specify the compilation by  using own Makefile and setting Make commands.</p>
          <p>When I hit the Run button (or use the Ctrl+F10 shortcut)  the executable is run. I would like to specify this i. e. to  specify custom command using predefined variables like  %executable etc. This command would be executed  every time when the Run button was hit.</p>
          <p>I think it would be useful to add another "Make  command" (in terms of project's Build options) which  would be executed by hitting the "Run" button. It is (at  least as I see it) an analogy to "Build project/target"  Make command which is executed by hitting the "Build"  button.</p>
          <p>Is that understandable? :)</p>

          <p>OK, I understand now, but I'm not sure this feature is exist. But what I can tell you is that there are some plugins which can let the user define there own command:</p>
          <p><a href="http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Tools%2B_plugin">http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Tools%2B_plugin</a></p>
          <p>Does this fit your desire?</p>
          <p>Also C::B has a build-in language called:  <a href="http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Category:Scripting_Code::Blocks">http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Category:Scripting_Code::Blocks</a></p>
          <p>You can put your custom command before or after you click the "build" command.</p>
          <p>BTW: you can ask your original question in c::b forum, I think there are many advanced c::b users who can help you more.</p>

          <p>User-defined tool is OK for my needs, thanks!</p>
          <p>Just.. Is it possible to add a button which would execute  this user-defined tool?</p>

          <p>I mean a button which could be added to a toolbar so  running of that tool would be possible "on one click".</p>
          <p>Or is it at least possible to bind the tool to a keyboard  shortcut?</p>

          <p>I have never use a custom tool button. So I can't tell about this feature.</p>
          <p>But I do know there is a shout cut key plugin, which works nicely.</p>
          <p>See: <a href="http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Keyboard_Shortcuts_plugin">http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Keyboard_Shortcuts_plugin</a></p>

          <p>Thanks again (I must have been blind, because I looked in  that menu today but I didn't see it).</p>
          <p>I'll try to live with a shortcut. If it turns out to be too  uncomfortable, I'll use the forum for my question. My  "problem" seems to be solved here then. I guess this  request can be closed (If you don't think this feature would  be nice anyway).</p>
