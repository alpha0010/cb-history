          <p class="lead">Just a couple of things..</p>
          <p>Scrolling the list of source files on the lefthand side using the scrollbar is a bit of a chore, could scrollwheel support be added?</p>
          <p>Also, I may be unaware of it, but is there some way to close tabbed source files with the mouse? If not I recommend something like firefox.</p>
          <p>P.S. The IDE is most impressive, I've recommended it to all my friends, keep up the good work!</p>

          <p>Scrollwheel is certainly supported (I use it all day, never used a scrollbar). Just make sure the pane has the focus.</p>
          <p>Tabs can be closed by clicking on them with the middle mouse button, by selecting "close" from the popup menu (right mouse button), or by clicking on the small "x" in the right corner.</p>
          <p>(the above refers to the present development version, in RC2 you can only use the popup menu)</p>

          <p>Just a slight addition: You can only scroll that window, if it is focused. And if you click it, and move the mouse away, it gets unfocused... And anyway, you have to click it first. No big thing, but sometimes annoying.</p>
          <p>It would be best, if the mouse pointer was monitored, and if it's over the box, and you scroll, the box would have the focus and not the editor ;)</p>
          <p>thnx</p>

          <p>This, however, is not possible, sadly.</p>
          <p>You cannot switch focus while scrolling, as you never receive this event. If the editor component has the focus (as it normally has) then the event is processed by wxScintilla and you never see it.</p>
          <p>The only way around it would be to use mouse enter/leave events to assign focus to the panel which is currently under the mouse. That, however, is not acceptable, since it would mean that you cannot type if the mouse is not over the editor!</p>
          <p>Thus, clicking into the manager window to give it the focus before using the scroll wheel is the correct solution.</p>
