          <p class="lead">project files - cross platform and slash</p>
          <p>I read about it somewhere in the forums, and I noticed that C::B now has an option to assign targets to platforms. This is great, now it seems that I can have a single project file for multiple platforms.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately there are some things that still make it difficult.</p>
          <p>1. C::B changed the file postfix of a shared library from *.so to *.dll in a project that is marked for Unix only.  2. C::B changed all frontslashes in paths in the whole file to backslashes.</p>
          <p>The main problem is that version control systems will show most of the file changed even I changed only few.</p>
          <p>I also noticed that the codeblocks project files in the svn repository are platform specific. Is it for reasons like above? Or are there some other issues.</p>
          <p>My rationale is: The project is what keeps a set of source files together and contains the rules to generate a target (binary) from them. The set of source file is often the same across platforms. (If it is not the case, I exclusively use c++-preprocessing for this issue.) So, when I add a source file, I would not want to add it to many project files.</p>
          <p>My suggestion to:</p>
          <p>1. only the basename without pre- and postfixes is stored in the file.</p>
          <p>2. The file contains only frontslashes - or - the file contains whatever the user may have entered. Or maybe let the user select in the configuration between the two. This would also apply to the files that are not related to targets (codefiles).</p>
          <p>--- btw: I like codeblocks and appreciate your effort a lot.</p>

          <p>Hi,</p>
          <p>time goes by, I am still using C::B</p>
          <p>But nobody answers to this request.</p>
          <p>So my question: Anybody using a versionning system with C::B and different development platforms including windows and unix?</p>
          <p>If yes, did nobody attempt to use one project file for both windows and unix?</p>
          <p>Codeblocks developers themselves seem to maintain two project files.</p>
          <p>I just wonder if there is any plan to change the mentioned issues, or does somebody have a completely different opinion?</p>
